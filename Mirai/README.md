We see, there is a Apache and a SSH server running.
We also know, Mirai was a botnet that spread by only checking IOT-Devices for default login.
So we go on the Webserver first and see: NOTHING. But why shouldn't we run nikto on it just to see if it got something juicy?
Lets see.
**NIKTO SNIPPET**
```+ OSVDB-3093: /admin/index.php: This might be interesting... has been seen in web logs from an unknown scanner.
```
After we go to the admin/index.php page, we see its a raspberry pi. After googling few minutes, the default login credentials for a raspberry pi are:
*pi:raspberry*
Let's go to SSH and login.
```ssh pi@10.10.10.48
pi@10.10.10.48's password:
